Plays back chat alongside Twitch VoDs.  Requires channel owner
approval to work on VoDs older than 2 days or on VoDs of
private broadcasts.  Go to [logsofshame.com](http://logsofshame.com/)
for details.

Tested with Chrome (Tampermonkey) and Firefox (Greasemonkey).

Chat data is not guaranteed to be complete or to exist, and so
this script may fail at any time because of that.  Any updates
Twitch makes to their chat system have a good chance of breaking
this userscript, as well.
